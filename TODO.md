# TODO

- Flexible timing options
    - "1st of the month"
    - "1st & 15th"
    - "One time" (use date picker --- starting cash is like this)
    - "Weekly" (date picker for days of the week?)
    - "Custom (7 days)" (e.g. 5 days)
- Consolidate "starting cash on hand" with "one time"
- UI clean up
    - Needs dropdowns, better editing
    - Should do in kc-widgets
- Save & restore
    - Generate random hex for save & restore
- UX improvements
    - Have a couple example "templates" from businesses
- Design clean up
    - Better first page, explaining what it is "Cash Flow Calc" "Budgeting
      Projection Tool", quickly project how much money you have, how quickly
      you earn it (income), how quickly you spend it (expenses)

# V2


- "Advanced mode"
    - Turn on with switch
    - Allows adding new "independent variables" (e.g. employees, customers,
      eating out)
    - These use the same math, and will also be overlayed on the graph
- UX improvements
    - Guided tour? (If a react thing that's easy exists, MAYBE)
    - Dots showing when expenses / income occurs, possibly icons
    - Showing
